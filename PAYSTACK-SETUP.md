# Paystack Integration Setup Guide

This document provides instructions on how to set up Paystack for processing payments in the eVote application.

## Overview

eVote uses Paystack to process payments for both votes and tickets. The integration handles secure payment processing with proper transaction management and confirmation emails.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following test credentials:

```bash
# Paystack Configuration - Test Mode
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_72a6543e2d567054e14ebc32855cf3cb36df8d71
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_e4049c4c3de9ac662c03d9d7f983d82a51c0d76c

# Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email Configuration (for ticket confirmations)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: These are test credentials - never use them in production!

### Important: Currency Configuration

To use GHS (Ghana Cedis) for payments:

1. **Paystack Account Setup**: Ensure your Paystack account is configured for Ghana and supports GHS currency
2. **Test Mode**: Test credentials automatically support GHS currency
3. **Live Mode**: Contact Paystack support if you encounter currency errors in live mode
4. **Business Verification**: Complete business verification with Paystack Ghana if required

If you see "Currency not supported by merchant" error:
- Verify your Paystack account country setting
- Contact Paystack support to enable GHS for your account
- Ensure you're using the correct API keys for your region

### 2. Test Card Details

For testing payments, use these test card details:

**Primary Test Card** (Always successful):
- **Card Number**: `4084 0840 8408 4081`
- **Expiry Date**: `12/25` (any future date)
- **CVV**: `123` (any 3 digits)
- **PIN**: `1234` (any 4 digits)
- **OTP**: `123456` (any 6 digits)

**Alternative Test Cards**:
- **Visa**: `4084 0840 8408 4081`
- **Mastercard**: `5060 6666 6666 6666 64`
- **Verve**: `5061 0201 1234 5678 09`

### 5. Webhook Configuration (Optional)

2. **Events to Monitor**:
   - `charge.success`
   - `charge.failed`
   - `transfer.success`
